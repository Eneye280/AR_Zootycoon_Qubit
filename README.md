To reach the maximum state of well-being for the animal, the exhibitions must be adequate and well structured, for example, for a lion the savanna environment is the most suitable and not another, since it would harm the lion's psyche and its emotional state would decrease , this situation being taken into account by the visitors of the zoo, thus damaging the reputation of the enclosure considerably. The options are varied and as much as the terrain, the foliage, the rocks, shelters, fences, toys and the presence of workers can be modified, since all these factors associated with the good organization of the zoo.
